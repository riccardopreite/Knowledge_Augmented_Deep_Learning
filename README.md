# Project for Bielefeld internship
During this project two existing neural network are used to test sentimental analysis on a dataset composed on review or short text.

# Existing model

The two model used are [VGCN](https://github.com/Louis-udm/VGCN-BERT) and [KEPLER](https://github.com/THU-KEG/KEPLER). 

## VGCN
 VGCN has been tested, without any change, on three dataset: CoLA, SST-2, IMDb.
## KEPLER
 KEPLER has been tested on three dataset as well but some changes were needed to adapt it to IMDb.
